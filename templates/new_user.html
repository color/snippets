<h1>Welcome to Weekly Snippets!</h1>

<p>We haven't seen <strong>{{username}}</strong> here before (that's you). To get started, please <b><a href="/settings?msg=Welcome!+Verify+the+settings+below+and+click+'Save'.&u={{username}}&redirect_to=snippet_entry">verify
  your settings</a></b> and you can get started writing snippets!</p>

<p>Confused why you're seeing this? Perhaps you accidentally logged in as the wrong
  user.  You can <a href="{{login_url}}">switch users</a>,
  or <a href="{{logout_url}}">log out</a> and log back in
  as the correct user.</p>
